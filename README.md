### Hello! I’m Sayed. 👋

 🔭 I develop computational models of biomechanical systems, to understand the neural control of movement. 

🎓 I recently finished my PhD in Biomedical Physiology and Kinesiology from the [Locomotion Lab](https://www.sfu.ca/locomotionlab/) at Simon Fraser University.

🏃 I collect and analyze gait data from 3D motion capture systems, force plates, EMG and wearable sensors. 

🌱 I am learning about data science, AI and machine learning. 

💬 Ask me about biomechanics, gait analysis, computational modeling and optimization.
